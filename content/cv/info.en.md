Since 2024, I am a post-doc at the Catholic University of Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium), where I work on injective deformation of meshes in the context of the [X-mesh](https://www.x-mesh.eu/) project, lead by [Jean-François Remacle](https://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-francois.remacle/) and Nicolas Moës.

I obtained a PhD from the University of Lorraine under the supervision of [Etienne Corman](https://members.loria.fr/ECorman/) and [Dmitry Sokolov](https://members.loria.fr/DSokolov/). I defended my PhD in December 2023.
