Since November 2025, I am a permanent Inria researcher in Grenoble (France). I work in the CRAFT research group, which studies the computationnal design and fabrication of objects with mechanical functions.  

From 2024 to September 2025, I was a post-doc at the Catholic University of Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium), where I worked on injective deformation of meshes in the context of the [X-mesh](https://www.x-mesh.eu/) project.  

I obtained a PhD from the University of Lorraine under the supervision of [Etienne Corman](https://members.loria.fr/ECorman/) and [Dmitry Sokolov](https://members.loria.fr/DSokolov/). I defended my PhD in December 2023.
