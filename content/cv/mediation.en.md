- I take part in Inria's program [Chiche!](https://chiche-snt.fr/1-scientifique/) whose goal is to make each French high school student meet a computer scientist. With this program, I've met a dozen of classes in high schools of eastern France between 2021 and 2023.

- In 2022, I participated  in the international French-speaking contest of popular science _Ma thèse en 180 secondes_, where I got the second best prize of the University of Lorraine for my talk. [[Video]]({{<ref path="/blog/mt180" lang="fr">}})

- During my PhD, I was also involved in a number of events, including the "Fête de la science" in 2022 and 2023 and the _European Researchers Night_ in 2022. In 2023, I also gave a general public conference about geometry processing and maps in High School Louis Vincent in Metz [[Video]]({{<ref path="/blog/fds_2023_louis_vincent" lang="fr">}}).
