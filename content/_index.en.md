I am currently a post-doc in computer science in the _Catholic University of Louvain_ (Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, UCL) in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. I work on the project [X-Mesh](https://www.x-mesh.eu/) which aims at meshing sharp physical interfaces in numerical simulations.

My area of research is the domain of _Digital Geometry Processing_. I am more precisely interested in the representations of the different geometry in computer science (point clouds, triangle meshes, quadmeshes, signed distance functions, ...), conversion algorithms between (reconstruction, remeshing, ...) as well as some useful applications of modern Deep Learning in the field.
